_sorry for my english, I'm trying to get better (:_

During the development of a project in Git, it may be necessary to modify the branch without losing changes already made ​​in another branch.

Git allows you to save the changes made and work on them later using the `git-stash`.

<!-- more --> 

##Usage##

``` bash
$ git status

# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#modified:   README.rdoc
#
```

in this case README.rdoc has changes, we save them using `git-stash`

``` bash
$ git stash

Saved working directory and index state WIP on master: 4a9db3e first
HEAD is now at 4a9db3e first
```

changes saved, the project is now in version without changes

``` bash
$ git status

# On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
```

To see which stashes you’ve stored, you can use `git stash list`

``` bash
$ git stash list

stash@{0}: WIP on master: 4a9db3e first
```

You can reapply the stash using the command `git stash apply`. If you have more than one stash, you can specify which stash you want to apply, see the example

``` bash 
$ git stash apply stash@{0}

# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#modified:modified   README.rdoc
#
```

To drop the stash use the command `git stash drop <NAME_STASH>` or when reapply the stash you can use the command `git stash pop <NAME_STASH>`, this way you reapply and drop the stash at the same time.

Is possible to do more things with this git tool, see more in this [link](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Stashing#Creating-a-Branch-from-a-Stash) [1].
